This distribution contains scripts to install the utilities
apxs, apr-config, and apu-config on Win32 for use with Apache2.
To install, at a DOS prompt run
   perl Configure.pl
which will attempt to find your top-level Apache2 directory.
If this is unsuccessful, or the guess is wrong, run
   perl Configure.pl --with-apache2=\Path\to\Apache2
The utilities will be placed under \Path\to\Apache2\bin\.

If you are building for Apache 2.1-dev/2.2, you will discover
that it's now httpd.exe, not Apache.exe. Specifying

  perl Configure.pl --with-apache-prog=httpd.exe

will provide the results you hoped for.

Bill Rowe <wrowe rowe-clan.net> provided the fixes necessary
for Apache 2.1-dev/2.2.
